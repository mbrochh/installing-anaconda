# Installing Anaconda

This repo is just a few notes on how to install Anaconda on your computer.

Sometimes I teach Introductory Python classes where use the Jupyter Notebook
and for that reason it can be useful to have Anaconda installed on your computer.

When installing Anaconda, it automatically also installs Python and a large set
of other comonly used libraries for data science and machine learning.

# MacOS

* Go to this page: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Download Anaconda (~461 MB)
* Double-click the downloaded file and install Anaconda
  * At step `Select a Destination` you can select `Install for me only`
  * Don't worry, when the installer says `Less than a minute`, it's probably
    going to take a bit more than a minute
  * At some point the installer will ask for access to the `Downloads` folder,
    you can click at `Yes`

## Start Anaconda-Navigator

Now that you have installed Anaconda, you should be able to start `Anaconda Navigator`:

* Open your `Finder`
* Click at the `Applications` folder
* Double-click `Anaconda-Navigator`

# Windows

* Go to this page: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Download Anaconda (~461 MB)
* Double-click the downloaded file and install Anaconda
  * At step `Install for` select `Just Me`
  * On the other steps, leave everythying at the default settings
  * Don't worry, the step `Setting up base environment...` will take a while.

## Start Anaconda-Navigator

Now that you have installed Anaconda, you should be able to start `Anaconda Navigator`:

* Click at the search bar in your Windows Start menu
* Search for `Anaconda Navigator` and execute it

# MacOS & Windows: Start Jupyter Notebook

When you have started the Anaconda-Navigator, look out for `Jupyter Notebook`
and click at `Launch`. 

It might ask you which browser you want to use. I would recommend Google Chrome.

Your browser should pop up and it will launch a website
at `http://localhost:8888/tree`. You will see all the files in your home
directory.

If you made it this far, everything works and you are ready to learn some Python!
